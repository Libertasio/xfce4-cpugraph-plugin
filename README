CPU Graph plugin for the XFce4 panel.

This plugin displays an graph from your latest system load.

Currently supporting Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
The *BSD support is from Riccardo's <riccardo.persichetti@tin.it> system load plugin.

i18n support is on it's way.

Known problems:
	* LED might look weird with some heights.
	* The drawing algorithms needs to be overlooked, they are
	_slow_.
	* If you have a 128px wide graph and high (< 500ms) 
	update interval, the tends to flicker. Guess this could 
	be solved with doublebuffering, but since I don't know 
	how to do that it's kinda hard. 

Please report any bugs to <alex.nordfelth@telia.com>

Hope this suite your needs.
Regards,
