2004-06-08 03:15 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c, panel-plugin/cpu.h: You can now change
	the color of the frame too. Rewrote the drawing algorithms to
	match better with the frame. I also removed some useless code
	from the algorithms, so everything should work much smoother 
	now.

2004-06-08 01:45 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c, panel-plugin/cpu.h: Reconstructed the
	settings dialog and added a option to draw a frame with the 
	graph.

2004-06-07 14:28 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c: Fixed bug where the plugin didn't
	center itself after panel resizing.

2004-06-07 03:30 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c, panel-plugin/cpu.h, panel-plguin/os.c,
	panel-plugin/os.h, panel-plugin/Makefile.am, configure.ac:
	Version 0.1.1, removed some text from configure.ac that
	didn't belong there.
	Converted all C++ related code to plain C due to possible
	bugs with the panel. The drawing area should also be 
	doublebufferd now.

2004-06-07 01:50 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc, panel-plugin/cpu.h, panel-plugin/os.cc:
	UpdateCPU now returns true instead of nothing. Fixed bug where
	plugin couldn't	compile on *BSD systems. (Thanks benny)

2004-06-06 18:03 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Fixed bug in "normal mode".

2004-06-06 17:01 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc, panel-plugin/cpu.h: Forgot to update 
	some funtions after removing global variables.

2004-06-06 16:40 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc, panel-plugin/cpu.h: Removed global 
	variables and fixed bug where expose_event didn't work.
	Fixed alignment setting for the width spin-button.

2004-06-06 03:13 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Fixed bug where the width was set
	to 4 if you switched to vertical panel mode.

2004-06-06 02:59 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Much nicer solution when centering
	the plugin.
	Now the plugin is strictly following the icon_size 
	defined sizes. (Which imo every plugin should follow.)
	
2004-06-06 01:25 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Fixed bug where the plugin didn't
	resize itself upon reading width/height.

2004-06-03 19:01 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Fixed bug where the plugin could 
	get larger than icon_size when changing orientation.
	
2004-06-03 15:40 phase
	
	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Added support for vertical panel 
	aswell.

2004-06-02 17:50 phase
	
	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc, panel-plugin/os.cc, 
	panel-plugin/os.h: Added support for FreeBSD, NetBSD 
	and OpenBSD. (Code from Riccardo's systemload plugin.)

2004-06-02 13:22 phase
	
	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Reconstructing the Get-CPU-Usage 
	part for better support of other OS's.
